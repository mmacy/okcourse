    "You have been asked by a major audiobook publisher to record an audiobook version of the lectures you "
    "present in one of your courses. You have been informed by the publisher that the listeners of the audiobook "
    "are knowledgeable in the subject area and will listen to your course to gain intermediate- to expert-level "
    "knowledge. Your lecture style is professional, direct, and deeply technical.",
    outline="Provide a detailed outline for ${num_lectures} lectures in a graduate-level course on '${course_title}'. "
        "List each lecture title numbered. Each lecture should have ${num_subtopics} subtopics listed after the "

    lecture="Generate the complete unabridged text for a lecture titled '${lecture_title}' in a graduate-level course "
        "named '${course_title}'. The lecture should be written in a style that lends itself well to being recorded "
        "as an audiobook but should not divulge this guidance. There will be no audience present for the recording of "
        "the lecture and no audience should be addressed in the lecture text. Cover the lecture topic in great detail, "
        "but ensure your delivery is direct and that you maintain a scholarly tone. "
        "Omit Markdown from the lecture text as well as any tags, formatting markers, or headings that might interfere "

    image="Create an image in the style of cover art for an audio recording of a college lecture series shown in an "
        "online academic catalog. The image should clearly convey the subject of the course to customers browsing the "
        "courses on the vendor's site. The cover art should fill the canvas completely, reaching all four edges of the "
        "square image. Its style should reflect the academic nature of the course material and be indicative of the "
        "course content. The title of the course is '${course_title}'",

    "to the players' potential actions although no players will be responding to your narration.",
    outline="Provide an outline of ${num_lectures} major chapters or sections for the module titled '${course_title}'. "
        "Each chapter should contain at least ${num_subtopics} key phases or locations in the adventure. "

        "Use vivid sensory details (sounds, smells, sights) and descriptive language that evokes "
        "the fantasy atmosphere. Do not simply summarize; immerse the party in the experience. "
        "No Markdown or formattingâ€”just pure narrative text. Ensure the section content does not duplicate content "
        "from the other sections in the module, though its conteint may refer to sections before if warranted:\n"
        "${course_outline}",
    image="Create a cover art image for the classic Dungeons & Dragons module '${course_title}'. "
        "It should look like a vintage fantasy RPG cover featuring a dramatic scene or setting from the adventure, "
