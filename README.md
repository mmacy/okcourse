# okcourse

The `okcourse` Python library generates audio courses for any topic by using artificial intelligence (AI) language, speech, and image models. You supply a topic for a course and the `okcourse` library uses an AI service provider's API to assemble:

- Course outline and lecture text from a large language model (LLM)
- Audio for the LLM-generated lectures from a text-to-speech (TTS) model
- Cover art for the course from an image model

The courses generated by the AI models and assembled by this library aren't exactly [Great Courses](https://www.thegreatcourses.com/). They're OK for use in becoming familiar with a topic or for pure entertainment, but as with any AI-generated drivel, you should question and verify the output rather than assume it's accurate and unbiased.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- OpenAI API key

To make things easier on yourself, you should also have Astral's [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/), though it's not strictly required.

## Installation

1. Clone this repo or use `uv add`

    Until I or another kind contributor gets to propping this thing to PyPi, you'll need to clone this repo or install `okcourse` as a dependency directly from GitHub.

    ```sh
    # Clone repo using SSH
    git clone git@github.com:mmacy/okcourse.git
    ```

    If you have [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), you can install the `okcourse` package into your uv-managed Python environment directly from GitHub:

    ```sh
    # Install okcourse as dependency from GitHub
    uv add git+https://github.com/mmacy/okcourse.git
    ```

1. Enable API access

    The `okcourse` library (and its example apps) look for an environment variable with an API token when creating the client to interact with the AI service provider's API.

    Set the environment variable appropriate for your AI service provider.

    - OpenAI: `OPENAI_API_KEY`
    - Anthropic - *not yet supported*
    - Google - *not yet supported*
    - ... - *not yet supported*

## Run example app

To see the library in action, generate your first course by running the example CLI application with `uv` and answering the prompts:

```sh
uv run examples/cli_example_async.py
```

Output from generating a four-lecture course with `cli_example_async.py` and `INFO` logging enabled looks similar to the following:

```console
$ uv run examples/cli_example_async.py

*BEHOLD!* A four-lecture audio course about ASI by AI, complete with AI-generated album art.

I'm guessing the two `I`s in "SERIIES" is for a double dose of intelligence.

The cover art features a stylized illustration of technology components, paperclips, and a robotic hand. The selected track, 'Artificial Super Intelligence: Paperclips All The Way Down,' is 17 minutes and 42 seconds long.](media-player-01.png)
