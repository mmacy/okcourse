# okcourse

The `okcourse` module generates audio lectures in MP3 format for any topic using Python and the OpenAI API. You supply a topic for the lecture series, the number of lectures in the series, and the LLM generates the series outline, lecture text, and audio for the entire series.

A real README will replace this one (for realsies), but for now, here's output from a run of the CLI example app generating a four-lecture "course" with logging enabled:

```console
$ uv run examples/cli_example.py

===================
? Enter a lecture series topic: Neutron star formation in depth
? How many lectures should be in the series (default: 20)? 4
? Generate MP3 audio file for lecture series? Yes
