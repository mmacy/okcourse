# Introduction

The `okcourse` Python library uses AI to generate audiobook-style courses in MP3 format with lectures on an any topic.

- :simple-python: [API reference](reference/index.md)

Given only a course topic of your choosing, the `okcourse` library handles all the prompting and API interaction required to:

- Generate a **course outline** and **lecture text** with an LLM
- Create **cover image** for the course by using an image model
- Produce an **audio file** from the lecture text using a text-to-speech (TTS) model

Curious about interstellar propulsion systems? Feed a catchy title to `okcourse` and you can fire up the course audio in your favorite media player in minutes. (1)

## OK for entertainment

The courses generated by the AI models and assembled by this library aren't exactly [The Great Courses](https://www.thegreatcourses.com/). They're fine for familiarizing yourself with a topic or for pure entertainment, but as with any AI-generated content, you should question and verify rather than assume unbiased accuracy.
