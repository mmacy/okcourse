# Introduction

The `okcourse` Python library generates audiobook-style courses with lectures on any topic by using artificial intelligence (AI).

You supply a topic for a course and the `okcourse` library uses an AI service provider's API to:

- Generate a **course outline** and **lecture text** with an LLM
- Create **cover image** for the course by using an image model
- Produce an **MP3 audio file** from the lecture text using a text-to-speech (TTS) model

## OK for entertainment

The courses generated by the AI models and assembled by this library aren't exactly [The Great Courses](https://www.thegreatcourses.com/). They're fine for familiarizing yourself with a topic or for pure entertainment, but as with any AI-generated content, you should question and verify rather than assume unbiased accuracy.
